# Covid-19: Data Exploration

For almost 3 years, we have been living with the Covid-19 Pandemic since it surfaced in November - December 2019. By exploring and analyzing the dataset, I hope to understand the current trend based on data

This project involves extracting the Covid-19 data (Covid deaths and vaccinations related) ranging from early February, 2020 to the end of July, 2022.

# Analysis Process

Utilizing SQL Server to perform data analysis on the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Performing basic data cleaning and querying on MS SQL Server to explore insights out of the data

Constructing visaualizaions on Tableau Public (including forecast analysis to predict the trend of Percent of population infected in some specific countries).

4 key areas interests me for me to perform further analysis:
- % Population Infected Per Country
- Global Covid Numbers
- Total Death Per Continents
- % Population Infected of 5 countries that I am interested in.
